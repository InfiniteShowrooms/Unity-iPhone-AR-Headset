# Unity-iPhone-AR-Headset
 Maintaining this cause’ I want more Unity devs to experiment with AR headsets. Uses ARkit + Unity ARfoundation to deliver stereoscopic pass-through AR with an iPhone + Google Cardboard headset (with a hole cut for the camera).


## Marvel Demo For Our 4yo Son

Used this project as a base and pulled in a bunch of SketchFab Mavel Models.

## Apple AR Headsets are around the corner. Why bother making this?

I want more Unity developers to experiment with low-cost AR headsets, so hence this open-source project (help wanted👋). 

It’s really wonderful running around a MASSIVE outdoor park wearing an AR headset and playing a game WITHOUT:
1. 1. Any infrared/full sunlight tracking issues
2. Any “guardian” play area restrictions
3. Fear of weather damage
🏞️🏃 🎉

Most #Unity devs can’t afford a Hololens. 🕶️

But then again, Hololens can’t do most of what I described above, either.🤷

Is it low-resolution, only 60fps, 200ms latency, and no hand controllers? 
Hell yes.😂

But after testing with 120+ people a solid 90 of them have never, ever mentioned ANY problems. 🎉🥳

(In fact, most were having so much FUN playing games I put together they stopped asking tech questions.🐉🎮)

Instead of waiting for the next AR hardware, I wanted to help more Unity devs build AR headset experiences with the hardware they already have.💙🚀
